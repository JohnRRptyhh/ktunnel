# To Do
- ~~Gracefull shutdown of tunnel on signal handler~~
- ~~Refactor commands with cobra~~
- ~~Support pod injection~~ - Not possible :\
- ~~Support "no injection"~~
- ~~Support multi pod deployment injection(create multiple tunnels and port-forwards)~~ - Not possible at the moment
- ~~Add "expose" subcommand(Create new deployment+service that forwards traffic to localhost)~~
- Add autocompletion sub-command
- Add examples section with:
    - ~~debugging a python application remotely~~
    - sending metrics to a local monitoring stack
    - nodejs remote debugging(based on [this](https://nodejs.org/de/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/#enabling-remote-debugging-scenarios))
- ~~Add docs(auto-generated from cobra)~~
- ~~Add goreleaser manifest and actions~~
- ~~Add cluster selection flag~~
- Add 'swap' subcommand for swapping deployment with a tunnel to the workstation
- Tests and CI
- refactor code to be better organized, testable and maintainable
- ~~switch from quay.io to other/self hosted registry to prevent rate limiting on build :(~~
- automatically update ktunnel.rb in hombrew-ktunnel after succesful version tag
